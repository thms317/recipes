Create beautiful HTML recipes from markdown.

The `recipes` project was generated by using the [RevoData Asset Bundle Template](https://github.com/revodatanl/revo-asset-bundle-templates) version `0.10.2`.

## Prerequisites

The project heavily depends on the provided `Makefile` for various tasks. Without [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) installed, you will need to run the commands described in the `Makefile` manually.

Note that on **Windows** we recommend using the DevContainer approach instead of manual setup. See the [DevContainer Instructions](docs/devcontainer.md) for detailed setup guidance.

## Installation

With [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) installed, run the following command to install the prerequisites and set up a fully configured development environment:

```bash
make setup
```

This will install the following prerequisites:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

![make-install](docs/assets/make-install.png)

Subsequently, this will use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to configure the correct [Python](https://www.python.org/) version specified in the `.python-version` file. Subsequently it will install the dependencies, set up a virtual environment, activate it, and install the pre-commit hooks.

## Clean up the development environment

To deactivate and remove the virtual environment, lock file(s), and caches, run the following command:

```bash
make clean
```

## Testing

The project has a structured testing approach with two types of tests:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in the `tests/unit` directory and focus on testing individual functions and components without external dependencies like Spark. These tests:

- Run during pre-commit hooks
- Are fast and lightweight
- Should be the primary type of test for most functionality

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are located in the `tests/integration` directory and focus on testing functionality that requires Spark operations. These tests:

- Are not run during pre-commit hooks
- Require a local Spark session
- Test data processing pipelines and Spark-specific functionality

### Running Tests

To run all tests (both unit and integration):

```bash
make test
```

In CI environments, both unit and integration tests are executed.


## Documentation

To auto-generate the documentation for the `recipes` project, run the following command:

```bash
make docs
```
