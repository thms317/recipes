# Setting up a Development Environment with DevContainers

This document explains how to set up a consistent development environment for Databricks Asset Bundles using DevContainers. This approach works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux** with minimal setup requirements.

This approach sets up Databricks Runtime, Python environment, development tools, VS Code extensions, and configuration to match your production environment.

## Prerequisites

You need these tools installed on your system:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Quick Start

1. **Authenticate your local machine**

   Set up authentication via `SSH` following this guide: [Use SSH keys to authenticate to Azure Repos](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops).

   Open a **PowerShell** terminal and generate keys by running:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa-sha2-256
   ```

   Don't bother to create a passphrase, just press `Enter` to skip it. The keys are now stored in `~/.ssh/`. Display the contents of the public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) by running:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   Copy the key to your **Azure DevOps** account by following the instructions in the guide.

2. **Configure Git**

   To configure Git with your correct name and email run:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

   Replace accordingly. Validate settings by running:

   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

3. **Clone Repo**

   Create a dedicated folder in your root folder and clone your projects there. There are multiple ways to do this, using the UI or the terminal. To use the terminal, to create a `code` folder and enter it, run:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/code
   cd ~/code
   ```

   Clone your project by running:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```

   There might be a question about the authenticity of the RSA key fingerprint you have just created; just type `yes` to continue.

4. **Build and Start the Dev Container**

   Open VS Code and navigate to the repo folder. Automatically it should pick up the `devcontainer.json` file and prompt you to build and reopen in container.

   When VS Code prompts you to "Reopen in Container" click on it, or:
   - Click the `Notifications` button in the bottom-right corner
   - Select "Reopen in Container"

   The first time you do this, VS Code will build the container (this might take a few minutes). Note that `Docker Desktop` is supposed to be running. When the container is running, you will see it in the bottom-left corner of VS Code:

## Using the Development Environment

### SSH and Databricks Authentication

The container automatically mounts:

- Your local SSH keys (from `~/.ssh`)
- Your Databricks configuration (from `~/.databrickscfg`)

If you see warnings about missing SSH keys or Databricks config, make sure these files exist on your host system.

### Validation

Once your container is configured and running, you can:

- Interact with repositories using `git` commands
- Run `make test` to run tests
- Deploy to Databricks using the `make deploy_dev` (or `make deploy_prd`) commands

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
2. Check that your SSH keys are properly configured
3. Verify your Databricks configuration is present in `~/.databrickscfg`
4. Try rebuilding the container if you experience dependency issues
