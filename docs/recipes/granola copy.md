## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Preheat** oven to 175°C (350°F)
2. **Line** a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for optimal crunchiness

### Mixing
3. In a large mixing bowl, **combine** all dry ingredients and mix well
4. In a separate bowl, **mash** the bananas thoroughly until smooth
5. **Add** the remaining wet ingredients to the mashed bananas and whisk until well combined
6. **Pour** the wet mixture over the dry ingredients
7. **Mix thoroughly** until every oat and nut is evenly coated
8. **Spread** the granola onto your prepared pan in a thin, even layer

### Baking
9. **Bake** for 25-30 minutes at 175°C (350°F), stirring carefully halfway through
10. For extra crunchiness:
    - Lower heat to 150°C (300°F) after the first 15 minutes
    - After stirring, press down firmly with a spatula
    - Leave small gaps between clusters for better air circulation

### Cooling
11. **IMPORTANT**: Let cool completely undisturbed for at least 45-60 minutes
12. Do not touch or stir while cooling - this is crucial for achieving clusters and crunchiness

### Finishing
13. Once completely cool, **add** a handful of raisins if desired
14. **Break** into pieces with your hands for chunks, or stir for a looser texture

## Storage Tips

- Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 to 2 weeks
- For maximum crunchiness, place a small piece of parchment paper on top before sealing the container
- If granola softens after a few days, refresh in a 150°C (300°F) oven for 5-10 minutes and allow to cool again

## Serving Suggestions

- Enjoy plain as a snack
- Serve with milk or yogurt for breakfast
- Sprinkle over ice cream or fruit for dessert
- Add to smoothie bowls for texture
- Use as a topping for baked apples or pears

## Recipe Notes

- **Nuts**: Feel free to use any combination of nuts and seeds you prefer
- **Sweetness**: Adjust maple syrup/honey to your taste preference
- **Texture**: The longer you leave the granola untouched while cooling, the chunkier it will be
- **Baking Sheet**: For maximum crunchiness, use parchment paper on a metal baking sheet rather than silicone/rubber mats
