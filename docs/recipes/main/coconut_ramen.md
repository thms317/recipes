- 1 tbsp freshly grated ginger
- 100 g shiitakes, torn
- 950 ml chicken broth or vegetable broth
- 400 ml unsweetened coconut milk
- 250 g instant ramen noodles
- 4 boiled eggs, cooked for 7 minutes
- 3 tbsp toasted sesame oil, divided
- 2 tbsp Thai red curry paste
- 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp sambal oelek or other chili paste (optional)
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/2 tsp brown sugar
- chili oil for serving
- sesame seeds for serving
- chopped chives for serving

## Instructions

1. Get the prep done before you start cooking: grate the garlic and ginger. Tear the shiitakes into small pieces.

2. Heat 1 tbsp sesame oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add shiitakes, and cook until they start to brown. Sprinkle with 1 tbsp sesame oil, season with salt and pepper, cook until crispy. Remove from pot.

3. Reduce the heat to low. Again, add 1 tbsp sesame oil, garlic and ginger. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Deglaze the pot with chicken broth, stir with a wooden spoon while scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of your pot. Bring to a boil.

4. Add turmeric, brown sugar, soy sauce and fish sauce. Stir in red curry paste and sambal. Add coconut milk and squeeze in lime juice. When the broth starts to boil, add ramen noodles and cook for 2 minutes (If not serving right away, cook the ramen noodles separately otherwise they'll soak up the broth).

5. Serve immediately finished off with shiitakes, sesame seeds, chives and chili oil. Top with eggs, enjoy!
