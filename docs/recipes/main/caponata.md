## Ingredients

- 2 large eggplants, cut into large chunks
- 500 gram ripe tomatoes (preferably Romas) roughly chopped
- 2 stalks celery from the inner, tender stalks (the heart), diced
- 1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 2-3 large garlic cloves, minced or finely sliced
- 2 red bell peppers, diced
- 1 heaped teaspoon dried oregano
- 3 heaped tablespoons salted capers
- 1 handful green olives, chopped
- 3 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar
- 1 small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
- 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts (optional)

## Instructions

1. Cut eggplants into large chunks (don't cut too small or they will absorb too much oil and become heavy).

2. Heat 2-3 tablespoons olive oil in a large, heavy nonstick skillet or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant chunks and oregano, season with salt and toss to coat evenly. Cook on high heat for 4-5 minutes, giving the pan a shake every now and then, until nice and golden on each side. Cook in batches if necessary depending on pan size.

3. Add the onion, celery, and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring, until the onion softens, about 5 minutes. Add the parsley stalks and cook together for another minute, until the garlic begins to smell fragrant.

4. Add the red bell peppers and ½ teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring, until just about tender, about 8 minutes. Feel free to add a little more oil if the pan feels too dry. The eggplant will fall apart.

5. Add the drained capers and olives, then drizzle over the vinegar. When the vinegar has evaporated, add the tomatoes with about ½ teaspoon salt and a pinch of sugar. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan often, for 15-30 minutes, until the vegetables are thoroughly tender and the mixture is quite thick, sweet, and fragrant.

6. Turn heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring often, until the mixture reaches your desired consistency. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and additional vinegar as needed.

7. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. If possible, cover and chill overnight for best flavor. Serve at room temperature, drizzled with good olive oil and sprinkled with chopped parsley leaves and toasted pine nuts if desired.

## Recipe Notes

- Always try to get firm aubergines with very few seeds - check at your local market for different colors
- Don't cut the aubergine chunks too small or they will absorb too much oil and become heavy
- The dish improves in flavor when allowed to rest overnight
- Can be served warm as a side dish or cold as an antipasto
