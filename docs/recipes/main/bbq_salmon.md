## Recipe Information

- **Servings:** 2-4 (depends on how much salmon you use)
- **Course:** main
- **Difficulty:** medium
- **Language:** EN

## Ingredients

### Salmon
- 454-909 g. fresh salmon
- 2 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (more for a larger filet)
- 2 tablespoon olive oil

### Mango Avocado Salsa
- 2 mangoes, diced
- 1 avocado, diced
- 4 grams minced cilantro
- 40 grams minced red onion
- 1/2 jalape√±o, minced (optional, to taste)
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 2 tablespoon lime juice + 1 teaspoon lime zest
- salt to taste

### For serving
- 279 grams of rice

## Instructions

1. Mango salsa: Toss all ingredients in a bowl to combine. Taste, adjust, try not to eat the whole bowl.
2. Cook your rice: Get your rice cooking according to package directions.
3. Get the oven ready: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Alternatively, you can set it to 500 degrees on the broil setting for medium rare with a yummy crispy top - the risk here is that you have to watch closely so it doesn't burn the sugar. If taking this route, make sure one of the oven racks is close-ish to the top, about 6 inches or so.
4. Salmon: Mix the spices and the olive oil to make a paste. Place the salmon skin side down on the baking sheet. Rub the paste liberally over the top part of the salmon. Bake for 6-12 minutes depending on the thickness of your salmon and your desired doneness.
5. Bowl it up: Pile up some rice, pull off some of salmon, and spoon that mango avocado salsa over the whole thing. Add a lime squeezer for good measure.

## Recipe Notes

- Salmon will change from translucent (red or raw) to opaque (pink) as it cooks. After 6-8 minutes of cooking, check for doneness, by taking a sharp knife to peek into the thickest part. If the meat is beginning to flake, but still has a little translucency in the middle, it is done.
- For those concerned about food safety, the salmon can be cooked until it has almost no translucency.
- A smaller filet (1-1.5 lbs) is recommended to avoid leftovers. A 2 lb. filet will serve 4-6 people easily.
- Fresh mangoes are most delicious, but frozen chunks can also work if thawed and cut to salsa-size.
- Additional vegetables like roasted mushrooms, asparagus, or cauliflower can be added to the bowls.
