## Ingredients

- 2 extra-large eggplants (680-800g each)
- 2 garlic cloves, finely minced
- 4 tbsp tahini paste
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp plain full-fat yogurt (optional)
- 125ml wood chips (mesquite, alder, or apple)

### For Garnish
- Olive oil
- Za'atar spice
- Fresh herbs like parsley
- Toasted pita bread

## Instructions

1. Preheat grill to medium-high (see notes below for roasting at 220°C).

2. Make a foil packet with wood chips for smoking. Wrap wood chips in heavy-duty foil and pierce the top, creating an opening so smoke can escape. Place this on the grill.

3. With a sharp paring knife cut 2-5cm deep slits into the eggplant, all over especially around the bigger bottom area. This will allow them to cook more evenly and help the smoke penetrate the eggplant.

4. When the foil packet is smoking, place the eggplant directly on the grill and close the grill. Turn eggplant every 10 minutes and let the skin char. Grill until eggplant has collapsed and feels tender on the inside, about 20 minutes.

5. Place the eggplant along with the smoking foil packet in a large bowl and cover tightly with foil. Let sit until cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes.

6. Save ALL the smoky liquid that is under the eggplant in the bowl. Peel the charred skin off the eggplant and using a knife, chop up the tender flesh. Place the eggplant in a strainer and strain for 10 minutes. Discard this liquid.

7. Place the drained eggplant in a mixing bowl. You should have 500ml of eggplant flesh. Add the tahini paste, garlic, lemon, salt, yogurt and 1-2 tbsp of the smoky liquid reserved from the bowl.

8. Mix, taste, adjust salt, lemon and smoke.

9. For delicious richness, add yogurt if using. Stir with a fork until relatively smooth.

10. Place in a shallow serving bowl, make a circular 'well' with the back of a spoon and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with your choice of Aleppo chili flakes, za'atar spice, or sumac. Sprinkle with fresh herbs. Serve with warm pita bread and/or vegetables.

## Recipe Notes

- **For Roasting:** Roast the eggplant in a 220-230°C oven. Slice in half lengthwise and roast with flesh side down on a parchment-lined sheet pan until very tender, about 60 minutes. Test by piercing the skin with a fork. Scoop out flesh, drain in a strainer for 10 minutes. Mash with a fork and add remaining ingredients. To achieve smoky flavor, add ½ tsp liquid smoke.
- If you end up with less than 500ml of eggplant flesh after draining, modify the additional ingredients accordingly.
