# Port-Caramelized Onions

These luxurious caramelized onions are cooked low and slow, then finished with aged port wine for a deep, complex flavor. Perfect for topping burgers, steaks, crostini, or stirring into pasta.

## Ingredients

- 900g (2 lbs, about 4 large) yellow or sweet onions
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves (optional)
- 1/4 cup (60ml) aged port wine (using your 300ml bottle)
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar (optional, if your port isn't very sweet)
- 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (optional, for added depth)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the onions**: Peel and halve the onions from root to stem. Slice them thinly into half-moons (about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick).

2. **Heat the pan**: In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat until the butter is melted and bubbling subsides.

3. **Add the onions**: Add all the sliced onions to the pan. They will fill it up quite high but will cook down substantially. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

4. **Initial cooking phase (10 minutes)**: Cook the onions over medium heat, stirring frequently, until they begin to soften and become translucent.

5. **Slow cooking phase (30-45 minutes)**: Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook the onions, stirring occasionally (about every 5-10 minutes), until they gradually turn golden brown. Be patientâ€”this is where the magic happens. If they start to stick, add a tablespoon of water and scrape up the brown bits.

6. **Port deglazing**: When the onions are deeply caramelized and reduced to about 1/4 of their original volume, add the port wine. Increase heat to medium and stir constantly, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

7. **Reduce the port**: Allow the port to simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and the onions are glossy and jammy, about 5-7 minutes. If using, add the brown sugar and/or balsamic vinegar in the last minute of cooking.

8. **Finish with herbs**: Stir in the fresh thyme leaves if using.
