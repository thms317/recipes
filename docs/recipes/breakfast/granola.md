## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients

- 300g (3 cups) old-fashioned rolled oats
- 150g (about 1 cup) mixed whole nuts:
    - 30g Sunflower seeds
    - 30g Cashews
    - 30g Pecans
    - 30g Almonds
    - 30g Peanuts
- 2.5g (½ teaspoon) fine table salt
- 5g (1 teaspoon) ground cinnamon

### Wet Ingredients

- 1.5 medium ripe bananas
- 50g (3 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon) olive oil
- 60g (¼ cup) natural crunchy peanut butter
- 75g (¼ cup) maple syrup or honey (or more)

- 5ml (1 teaspoon) vanilla extract

## Instructions

### Preparation

- Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F)
- Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper

### Mixing

- In a large mixing bowl, combine all dry ingredients and mix well
- In a separate bowl, mash the bananas thoroughly until smooth
- Add the remaining wet ingredients to the mashed bananas and whisk until well combined
- Pour the wet mixture over the dry ingredients
- Mix thoroughly until every oat and nut is evenly coated
- Spread the granola onto your prepared pan in a thin, even layer

### Baking

- Bake for 15 minutes at 175°C
- Stirring thoroughly halfway through, press down with a spatula to create clusters
- Bake for an additional 30-45 minutes at 150°C
- If needed, bake for another 30 minutes at 120°C (250°F) for extra crunchiness after cooling (1-24 hours)

### Cooling

- IMPORTANT: Let cool completely undisturbed for at least 45-60 minutes
- Do not touch or stir while cooling - this is crucial for achieving clusters and crunchiness

### Finishing

- Once completely cool, add a handful of raisins if desired
- Break into pieces with your hands for chunks, or stir for a looser texture

## Notes

- **Storage**: Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 to 2 weeks
- **Nuts**: Feel free to use any combination of nuts and seeds you prefer
- **Texture**: The longer you leave the granola untouched while cooling, the chunkier it will be
- **Baking Sheet**: For maximum crunchiness, use parchment paper on a metal baking sheet rather than silicone/rubber mats
